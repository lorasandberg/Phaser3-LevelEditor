Simple tiled level editor built with Phaser 3 and Typescript.

To set up, run:
```
npm install
npm run watch
```
The app should open in your browser automatically, but if it doesn't, open http://localhost:10001/.

There are three different versions of the app, in three different git branches:
- master branch has basic MVP map editor.
- games branch has an additional game you can try the map with.
- arrow-keys branch has alternative arrow key controls instead of mouse/pointer controls.

To switch branches, use:
```
git checkout master
git checkout games
git checkout arrow-keys
```
